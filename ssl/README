In case you want to use your own SSL certificates (instead of LetsEncrypt),
then copy your ca.key and ca_chain.crt files in this directory and uncomment
the following section in the traefik.toml file.

# [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
      # certFile = "ssl/ca_chain.crt"
      # keyFile = "ssl/ca.key"
