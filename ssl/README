Copy your ca.key and ca_chain.crt files in this directory and uncomment the following section in the traefik.toml file:

# [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]]
      # certFile = "ssl/ca_chain.crt"
      # keyFile = "ssl/ca.key"

Step #2: 

Comment out the acme section in the traefik.toml file:

# [acme]
# storage = "acme.json"
# onHostRule = true
# entryPoint = "https"
#   [acme.httpChallenge]
#   entryPoint = "http"

Step #3: 

Remove the --acme.email=${EMAIL} from reverse-proxy command section in the docker-compose.yml file.
